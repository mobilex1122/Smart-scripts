# Osu wayland/xfce runner

[Osu lazer download](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/latest)


## Files:
`osu-otd` = run osu on wayland with otd auto setup (more info in OTD setup section)
	


## Basic setup (all files):
Just edit the osupath varible to match yours and you are done with setup.
	
## OTD (OpenTabletDriver) setup:
to setup otd to be compatible with this script you have two options:

### A. you need to make two presets with correct names (easy to make):
You need one for normal tablet usage and one when playng osu. Names of those presets are:
1. `normal.json` (for normal usage)
2. `osu.json` (for osu usage)
### B. you need to edit the script to load correct preset (if you don't code this might be harder)




## Progress
- [x] Make simple script
- [ ] Make gui version of it
