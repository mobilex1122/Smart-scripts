# Osu wayland runner

## Files:
	osu-otd = run osu on wayland with otd setup (more info in OTD setup section)
	
	
	
## OTD (OpenTabletDriver) setup
	to setup otd to be compatible with this script you have two options:
	1. you need to make two presets with correct names (easy to make):
		You need one for normal tablet usage and one when playng osu. Names of those presets are:
			1. `normal.json` (for normal usage)
			2. `osu.json` (for osu usage)
	2. you need to edit the script to load correct preset (if you don't code this might be harder)


- [x] Make simple script
- [ ] Make gui version of it
